single page application importance
react, angular

-less round trip 
first template navigation and footer 
and remaining data are fetched dynamically


hosting and deploying asp.net core application:
application run in visual studio
exe file windows 

hosting model => in-process hosting, out-of-process hosting


in-process=> software for hosting application
we store our application
1.wenbserver->iis, internet infrastructure system
iis => window op vako web server cannot be used in Linux
Linux => apache engine 

out-of-process => Linux, mac, windows running asp.net core

kestrel server -> lightweight server to run asp.net core application in cross platform

https - in run windows
this is out-of-process

iis express


dotnot --info
dotnet --list-sdk =>software development kit

development kit run garna ko lagi
